# Predicting-Car-Prices

**This is a small Data Science and ML project that I replicated during my DataScience Learning from one of Udemy's courses.**

The project reads a csv file, visualises the differe characteristics of the data prsesented inside the dataset, pre-processes the data by replacing null values with median values, converting string to categorical values, parsing date time and visualising many different components of the data to grab a clear Idea on what the data-set presents.


After preprocessing the data, the dataset is used to fit a RandomForestRegressor to predict the price of vehicles based on the information provided in the data-sets.

The data-set can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data


The project tried to provide enough documentation with the code, where explaining what is the specific reason for coding in that particular way has been the goal.

#### To run the project, please run `Predicting Car Prices.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook or preferred Notebook. 
#### To view the code only for seeing the work, you can open the `Predicting Car Prices.pdf`.
